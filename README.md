# Dispatcher

A version of the Flux Dispatcher from FaceBook ported to Swift.

This is currently on Swift 1.2 because that's what we are using but I plan to update to Swift 2.0 fairly soon.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

The original Dispatcher is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Dispatcher"
```

For this repo, you can use a custom podspec. If there is a desire to use this fork then open an Issue and I can create an official podspec for it. It may also be that the original author will want to merge this upstream.
